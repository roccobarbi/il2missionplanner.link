# Il-2 Mission Planner

Welcome to the `il2missionplanner.link` repository. This repository houses the code behind the Il-2 Mission Planner tool, a simple client-side javascript application based primarily on [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/).

This project is derived from the original [il2missionplanner.com](https://github.com/gavincabbage/il2missionplanner.com) project, released under the MIT license by [Gavin Cabbage](https://github.com/gavincabbage). At the time of replicating the project, the last commit on the original one was [47a1255021d3e411333e8162a486bb6988d4d95e](https://github.com/gavincabbage/il2missionplanner.com/commit/47a1255021d3e411333e8162a486bb6988d4d95e).

Once the project is online the latest stable release will become available at [il2missionplanner.link](http://il2missionplanner.link), the beta release may become available at [beta.il2missionplanner.link](http://beta.il2missionplanner.link). At the time of writing this readme file, I haven't been able to estimate the infastructure cost yet, therefore I can't promise that the website won't be behind a paywall (likely a very small fee to cover costs only).
