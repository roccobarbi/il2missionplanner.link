# Contributing to il2missionplanner.link

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

il2missionplanner.link aims at being developed and maintained as a community project. All help from the il2 community
(and from the developer / open source community in general) is greatly appreciated.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs and Feature Requests

If you believe something is not working as expected, or that a new feature should be added to word_pattern, feel free to
[open an issue here](https://github.com/roccobarbi/il2missionplanner.link/issues). Before opening an issue, read through
the existing open issues to check if someone already asked for what you desire. If you find either the same request, or
a very similar one, please do not open a duplicate issue, but rather comment the existing one to either show your
support or (preferably) add some new input to improve it. A healthy debate between maintainers and users is essential to
improving this project.

If the feature you're requesting requires domain-specific knowledge, please add all necessary details. For example, if
a knowledge of aviation or some specific math formulas is required, do include all necessary information in the ticket.
Please be mindful that it is possible that developers that don't share any interest in il2 or aviation may contribute to
this project (it does happen with open source projects that developers contribute only to practice a specific language
on something that is technically easy enough for them).

### Contributing code

Before contributing code, please go through the process of opening an issue and assigning it to yourself. I strongly
encourage the use of labels and
[assigning it to this project](https://github.com/roccobarbi/il2missionplanner.link/projects/1). If you forget about the
last two steps, no harm done: a maintainer will take care of it as soon as he spots it.

In order to contribute code, please fork the project and create a new branch with a descriptive name. The  branch name
must be all lowercase, hyphen-separated text and it must begin with a letter. I strongly encourage the  format
{username}-issue-{issueId}-name. {username} should be your username on github, {issueId} should be the id of the  id of
the issue, expressed as a fixed-with integer of 4 digits (with leading zeroes to pad it).

Once you're done with your changes, please bring your branch up to date with main. Then submit a pull request, which
should detail at minimum:
- what the changes are about;
- a brief description of how they work;
- why it should be accepted.

Since all changes must be tracked using issues, the pull request must also include a reference to an issue (generally
using the "closes" keyword).

### Contributing reviews

Any feedback on open pull requests is greatly appreciated, provided that it is relevant and based on an analysis of the
conversation, linked issue and code changes. Open pull requests
[can be found here](https://github.com/roccobarbi/il2missionplanner.link/pulls).
